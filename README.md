## dpeak example

This is a simulator for ChIP-seq SET reads from the model proposed by
Chung et al. (2013).

It also includes a position - fragment length exploration heatmap to
see the behaviour of the signal for various fragment lengths.

To run this example, it is necessary to do:

```{r}
shiny::runGithub("dpeak_example","welch16")
```

The code to use dpeak is in
[here](https://github.com/dongjunchung/dpeak) and the paper is in
